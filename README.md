# File-Based-Q-A-Chatbot
This AI-powered chatbot processes PDFs, Word documents, Excel files, and images, enabling users to ask questions and receive answers based on the content. Built with Gradio and powered by the LLaMA 3.2 model, it streamlines information retrieval from diverse document formats.

This project introduces an AI-powered chatbot designed to facilitate seamless interactions between users and various document types through natural language queries. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of the LLaMA 3.2 model, the application processes and extracts text from a diverse array of file formats, including PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and images. Upon uploading a file, the system utilizes specialized libraries—such as pdfplumber for PDFs, python-docx for Word documents, pandas for Excel files, and pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in images—to accurately extract textual content. The extracted text is then analyzed by the LLaMA 3.2 model, which generates insightful and contextually relevant responses to user queries based on the document's content. The user-friendly interface, developed using Gradio, ensures a seamless experience by allowing effortless file uploads and interactive conversations. This tool is particularly beneficial for individuals and professionals who require efficient data extraction and analysis from various document formats without the need for manual processing. By integrating advanced AI language models with robust text extraction techniques, the chatbot streamlines information retrieval, making it a valuable asset for tasks such as document review, data analysis, and content summarization. The project exemplifies the practical application of AI in enhancing productivity and accessibility in document management and analysis.
